# Notes App – Full-Stack Technical Assignment

This project is a small full-stack web application built as part of a technical interview assignment.  
It allows users to create, update, view, and search notes that are persisted in a database.

The goal of the solution is clarity, simplicity, and a clean separation between frontend and backend.
